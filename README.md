# DJI Mobile SDK and OpenCV example : Drone AI #

**This README is incomplete. Give me like 2-3 hours.**

Single-man college project where I had to use a drone (DJI Matrice 100) to do three specific goals : 

    A) Make the drone follow a precise course (featuring loops)
    B) Make the drone follow a line in the school's gymnasium
    C) Make the drone find a ball in the school's gymnasium (this goal was cancelled due to time restrictions)

## Technologies used ##

Java
Android Studio
OpenCV
DJI Mobile SDK
Matrice 100 (drone)
